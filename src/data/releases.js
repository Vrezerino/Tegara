Lunatic glitter lines all thought threads

A square assembly of a dozen cypresses
Only an enigma of wintry doggedness`,

        lyrics: `Twice-born clock wrapped in a void absurd
Still life of mind-consumed wretched minutes
As complacent as it was vivid
This disarray of yours an assortment of deaths

Persona exploded and reassembled
Gadarene configuration tempered
Runtime errors all snubbed and unhandled
A thermally toughened new idiot maintained

Once again tethered to a fresh shell fougasse
Time only still in a corner of green granite
Steelblue ladybugs rotate in place
New solace lies in the fate's odd creek

An expanse of scenery where a mind is born unsecured
You are most real and undefined
Conchoidal lies shimmer and play in red gold
Visit the pitiable enigma of desires

Everything is you and it is contained
Cast only light and devour a shore
Music up in a swell before commercial
And here is a scene from next week's gestalt`,

Lobotomized reality on a spinning dais
Contemptible decalcomanias of pretension
Anywhen a xylene touch of restoration

Front is behind my static eyes
Strike an unresponsive chord contorted
Lest I be perturbed by bedrock
A chariot drawn by tigers flies me away

Eyeing askance at subatomic lies
Distill and bathe in aromatic axioms
Meant to be distorted and pulled apart
Calls for my prompt treatment the siccative framework

Uncreate
Mutilate
Dissolve
Resolve

How come time is a snap of my fingers
Divine and insane reality-impulse
Speak the truth of hypnagogic lies
Outside the interlaced frames around us

Travertine floor boundless in all directions
Brass lions and archs sprung from a bust
Open place forever contained in amber dusk

Reassembled bookshelves fall
Three fields over a fanfare sounds
Interlacing qualms materialize

No content
All that would and did take place
Paints each page vantablack
For agitation to erase them repeatedly

That's my unit; they're here for me
My disdain grows ever larger
Convalescence will not be
Rotating gravity torques my inner ears

Doused in battery-acid risen from empty words
Dividend or divisor, which one is the lie

No content

When prevarications cease corroding
I wake into an alkaline oleander

Going into the me below
Lose me in corporeal insanity pre-programmed
The pothole would rise to submerge me

I'm divided by the reciprocal of me
I squared is I — I am potential — I am all products
This insane firmware, the growling memory
I am the end-user of feverish static

A lamenter catching reflections from within
You, a seasoned sifu of requiems
The dirge master playing the largest violin

Abhorring de-opacifications
Commenced before the succession of realities
Ants saturating all configurations
Unflaggingly hiking on corpuscles

Over-easy eggs hanging from crutches
Overlooking inverted Monet skies
Would I like them boiled by the amplified noise floor
Should I consume the resurrection of Christ

The howling clouds gliding in our eyes
We know peace when they are restless
Mists sailing on staff, allegro
Playing the song of tristesse deathless

Tangent to my deeds, the conduct; my actions,
refulgent with viscosity
Swallowing into themselves,
pinioned motions continually enmeshed

To nullify the shrieking nothingness,
the successional blustering intervals
I drag weights of bedrocks with me
I bring together impossible walls

A suspended line, a tense fiber
Cutting through ether unbent
The ray of my soul, impartible
Accompanying one's deafening tranquil

Fuck you motherfucker and
let me perform a song of
mourning for you right now

The howling clouds gliding in our eyes
We know peace when they are restless
Mists sailing on staff, allegro`,

You have welcomed yourself
Confluence only an animate fist knows
Misadventure that Shackleton envies

Inkling in advance of all
Have you ever seen the orchestra
Playing not on the mezzanine
But on the highest balcony

What privilege to have been succumbed
To a crescendo
Slabs of not turpitude
A stauchwall not of senseless wrath

Participation you will not abhor
Your haughty strides we ask to halt
You must observe well-deserved resplendence

I give credit where credit is due
You created fantastic incomprehensiveness
Here is a signature of Debasement
So your royalties will be paid in full

Amusing, rash crown fracture lines
Rushing to hasten an onslaught to ravage
No more evident can cause and effect be
In an inverted quietus space

I see from above
I have redeemed myself
Gremlins introduced to the outcrop
Imps subdued and squelched

The transient knows of substance
Halt and feel no more
Contemptuous impulse-latensification
Perfunctory smile of a static eum-yang `,

For it to emerge as buried opposite
Now first inhibited and broken down
Here cathexis of forces into power

I observe, calculate and gaze upon
I do nothing and everything
Your jaw glimmers and rotates
Your eyes uncased but not looking

Your obvious, excessive commitment
To collective, masking ideals
Your persona a mere semblance
Explosion precedes individuation

Adornments we do not care for
Veils so false and insipid
Within confines of tighter limits
Your operose patching up miscarries

Speak
Weep
Screech
Heal

Pretend you are now what you were
You are the protagonist with a reputation
Negative restoration of your persona
A caricature now brought about

But dreaded for tactlessness
Trapped and blind to the world
A spectral Cassandra in disturbed state
This possibility could you endure?`,

Enveloping iodine clock reaction
Shakes me to my core, melts my face
Terror-embracement not an aberration

The Sun screams at me naked
Blinded I am, yet it keeps blinding me
A thread of penance in me vibrated
Viscera manipulated by chordal chords within

Coruscating eyeballs inquire in fear
Stunned phantoms tune into nothing
Ionizing penalty at once imposed
On us within the governance of life king

Oh!

Conjunct motifs of regret and demise
Are forever contained, never progressing
Verily I say unto each of you
Scorching affright-melody with you you're taking

See your disintegration in real time
Wake up and observe your fall into ruin
Hear yourself become an interference pattern
Your constituents are repelling each other

An ill trick of fate
Can consequences be tied to actions
Do not deduce — brush everything off
Dismissal, just as futile and otiose

Regulations there are not!
What use are limitations in your final process
Who is judging you on your way out
Why shouldn't you prance around before death

Assaulting imagery of your kaleidoscope
Fades out when you figure out your surroundings
Doom-ostinatos stop dead in their tracks
Fear has been pushed out of the sweat glands
Curtains close on your emotions
Was there a lesson that survives the encore`,

Innocent cascades of marred waves
Each iteration of me wandering here
The liminal walls brood just the same

Persistence of impressionist fair weather
Speaks to me of incandescent gloom
Quests with no purpose stringed together
Tied around a neck of arcanum

I am awake in the same place
Eyes peeled for dissatisfaction
Evoked nothing the vignette of a dream
This is content — in it motions my chords

Mute visage of this coniferous hill
As if waiting for me to unearth verity
Beckons me to stand in my ashen feel
Moribund ether an atmosphere of peat

Hypnagogia a refraction boundary
No state the image doesn't live in
Tarnished by mystery in gradient
Is my own elysian reverie reflected back to me`,

Oceans of stochasticity

Drummed to bits, these all will be; sojourn

And illuminating
With flashes of void
Fluid serialized

Feral actions determined
Fanatic cruelties for
Ourselves enclosing on
Ritualistic deconstruction

Decadence remorseless
Filling the atmosphere
Ruinous conflagration
Ending cycles of hubris

Visions speak of ailing ground
Twisting through me
