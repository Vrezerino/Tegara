You will never be oneness

Bite down on your fucking neck

You are most present when absent
Soul not random, not stochastic`,

Lunatic glitter lines all thought threads
In a gelid world is sangfroid born
Within suspended phantasmagoria we prance

And is it that everything could be
Not un-being from beingness between
A square assembly of a dozen cypresses
Only an enigma of wintry doggedness`,

Reassembled bookshelves fall
Three fields over a fanfare sounds
Interlacing qualms materialize

No content
All that would and did take place
Paints each page vantablack
For agitation to erase them repeatedly

That's my unit; they're here for me
My disdain grows ever larger
Convalescence will not be
Rotating gravity torques my inner ears

Doused in battery-acid risen from empty words
Dividend or divisor, which one is the lie

No content

When prevarications cease corroding
I wake into an alkaline oleander

Going into the me below
Lose me in corporeal insanity pre-programmed
The pothole would rise to submerge me

I'm divided by the reciprocal of me
I squared is I — I am potential — I am all products
This insane firmware, the growling memory
I am the end-user of feverish static

        title: 'Threnodist',
        lyrics: `Blessed is he who keeps pulling threads
A lamenter catching reflections from within
You, a seasoned sifu of requiems
The dirge master playing the largest violin

Abhorring de-opacifications
Commenced before the succession of realities
Ants saturating all configurations
Unflaggingly hiking on corpuscles

Over-easy eggs hanging from crutches
Overlooking inverted Monet skies
Would I like them boiled by the amplified noise floor
Should I consume the resurrection of Christ

The howling clouds gliding in our eyes
We know peace when they are restless
Mists sailing on staff, allegro
Playing the song of tristesse deathless

Tangent to my deeds, the conduct; my actions,
refulgent with viscosity
Swallowing into themselves,
pinioned motions continually enmeshed

To nullify the shrieking nothingness,
the successional blustering intervals
I drag weights of bedrocks with me
I bring together impossible walls

A suspended line, a tense fiber
Cutting through ether unbent
The ray of my soul, impartible
Accompanying one's deafening tranquil

Fuck you motherfucker and
let me perform a song of
mourning for you right now

The howling clouds gliding in our eyes
We know peace when they are restless
Mists sailing on staff, allegro`,

        lyrics: `Ah, you see from below
You have welcomed yourself
Confluence only an animate fist knows
Misadventure that Shackleton envies

Inkling in advance of all
Have you ever seen the orchestra
Playing not on the mezzanine
But on the highest balcony

What privilege to have been succumbed
To a crescendo
Slabs of not turpitude
A stauchwall not of senseless wrath

Participation you will not abhor
Your haughty strides we ask to halt
You must observe well-deserved resplendence

I give credit where credit is due
You created fantastic incomprehensiveness
Here is a signature of Debasement
So your royalties will be paid in full

Amusing, rash crown fracture lines
Rushing to hasten an onslaught to ravage
No more evident can cause and effect be
In an inverted quietus space

I see from above
I have redeemed myself
Gremlins introduced to the outcrop
Imps subdued and squelched

The transient knows of substance
Halt and feel no more
Contemptuous impulse-latensification
Perfunctory smile of a static eum-yang `,

For it to emerge as buried opposite
Now first inhibited and broken down
Here cathexis of forces into power

I observe, calculate and gaze upon
I do nothing and everything
Your jaw glimmers and rotates
Your eyes uncased but not looking

Your obvious, excessive commitment
To collective, masking ideals
Your persona a mere semblance
Explosion precedes individuation

Adornments we do not care for
Veils so false and insipid
Within confines of tighter limits
Your operose patching up miscarries

Speak
Weep
Screech
Heal

Pretend you are now what you were
You are the protagonist with a reputation
Negative restoration of your persona
A caricature now brought about

But dreaded for tactlessness
Trapped and blind to the world
A spectral Cassandra in disturbed state
This possibility could you endure?`,

Resurface with decompression sickness

Will it not collide

Reinstatement initialized
Begin a transfiguration total
Decontamination of your network
A funeral pyre of all

Placid, compose, unshaken
Unperturbed, lubricated

Keep throwing yourself forward
You are unfettered and unperturbed
Twist and turn intrinsic redshifts blue

Reality is what you're vitrified in
Pinioned while 'reborn' inside a catacomb
I am beside you and limber as the wicopy

        lyrics: `Suddenly the blue sky was pulled away
Enveloping iodine clock reaction
Shakes me to my core, melts my face
Terror-embracement not an aberration

The Sun screams at me naked
Blinded I am, yet it keeps blinding me
A thread of penance in me vibrated
Viscera manipulated by chordal chords within

Coruscating eyeballs inquire in fear
Stunned phantoms tune into nothing
Ionizing penalty at once imposed
On us within the governance of life king

Oh!

Conjunct motifs of regret and demise
Are forever contained, never progressing
Verily I say unto each of you
Scorching affright-melody with you you're taking

See your disintegration in real time
Wake up and observe your fall into ruin
Hear yourself become an interference pattern
Your constituents are repelling each other

An ill trick of fate
Can consequences be tied to actions
Do not deduce — brush everything off
Dismissal, just as futile and otiose

Regulations there are not!
What use are limitations in your final process
Who is judging you on your way out
Why shouldn't you prance around before death

Assaulting imagery of your kaleidoscope
Fades out when you figure out your surroundings
Doom-ostinatos stop dead in their tracks
Fear has been pushed out of the sweat glands
Curtains close on your emotions
Was there a lesson that survives the encore`,

Innocent cascades of marred waves
Each iteration of me wandering here
The liminal walls brood just the same

Persistence of impressionist fair weather
Speaks to me of incandescent gloom
Quests with no purpose stringed together
Tied around a neck of arcanum

I am awake in the same place
Eyes peeled for dissatisfaction
Evoked nothing the vignette of a dream
This is content — in it motions my chords

Mute visage of this coniferous hill
As if waiting for me to unearth verity
Beckons me to stand in my ashen feel
Moribund ether an atmosphere of peat

Hypnagogia a refraction boundary
No state the image doesn't live in
Tarnished by mystery in gradient
Is my own elysian reverie reflected back to me`,

In your face explodes compounded tramples

Hasn't he lost his voice already
Hasn't she masticated your decay

Doesn’t for me total death blaze

Ebullient, exuberant, riotous, excessive
I'm shaped into myself
I steamroll the blades of quiescence
Solvent for my moratorium

Mendacity dissolved
Inverted on themselves doldrums within me
My suspension, the blistering abeyance

Potent springs of omnipotence
explode to displace defeats

In mid-air interpolate,

Dissolved by ants
Destroyed by battering crests

Generations of noise
Oceans of stochasticity

Drummed to bits, these all will be; sojourn

And illuminating
With flashes of void
Fluid serialized

Feral actions determined
Fanatic cruelties for
Ourselves enclosing on
Ritualistic deconstruction

Decadence remorseless
Filling the atmosphere
Ruinous conflagration
Ending cycles of hubris

Bedrock sleeps stoic
Visions speak of ailing ground
Twisting through me
Mind's-eye sees true

Owned by the tides
