  "Ultra Vesaniam": {
    Prodome: `Just a cue to a break from jade gray
Reassembled bookshelves fall
Three fields over a fanfare sounds
Interlacing qualms materialize

No content
All that would and did take place
Paints each page vantablack
For agitation to erase them repeatedly

That's my unit; they're here for me
My disdain grows ever larger
Convalescence will not be
Rotating gravity torques my inner ears

Doused in battery-acid risen from empty words
Dividend or divisor, which one is the lie

No content

When prevarications cease corroding
I wake into an alkaline oleander

Going into the me below
Lose me in corporeal insanity pre-programmed
The pothole would rise to submerge me

I'm divided by the reciprocal of me
I squared is I — I am potential — I am all products
This insane firmware, the growling memory
I am the end-user of feverish static

  Threnodist: {
    "Black Sky Sunbath": `Suddenly the blue sky was pulled away
Enveloping iodine clock reaction
Shakes me to my core, melts my face
Terror-embracement not an aberration

The Sun screams at me naked
Blinded I am, yet it keeps blinding me
A thread of penance in me vibrated
Viscera manipulated by chordal chords within

Coruscating eyeballs inquire in fear
Stunned phantoms tune into nothing
Ionizing penalty at once imposed
On us within the governance of life king

Oh!

Conjunct motifs of regret and demise
Are forever contained, never progressing
Verily I say unto each of you
Scorching affright-melody with you you're taking

See your disintegration in real time
Wake up and observe your fall into ruin
Hear yourself become an interference pattern
Your constituents are repelling each other

An ill trick of fate
Can consequences be tied to actions
Do not deduce — brush everything off
Dismissal, just as futile and otiose

Regulations there are not!
What use are limitations in your final process
Who is judging you on your way out
Why shouldn't you prance around before death

Assaulting imagery of your kaleidoscope 
Fades out when you figure out your surroundings
Doom-ostinatos stop dead in their tracks
Fear has been pushed out of the sweat glands
Curtains close on your emotions
Was there a lesson that survives the encore`,
    Threnodist: `Blessed is he who keeps pulling threads
A lamenter catching reflections from within
You, a seasoned sifu of requiems
The dirge master playing the largest violin

Abhorring de-opacifications
Commenced before the succession of realities
Ants saturating all configurations
Unflaggingly hiking on corpuscles

Over-easy eggs hanging from crutches
Overlooking inverted Monet skies
Would I like them boiled by the amplified noise floor
Should I consume the resurrection of Christ

The howling clouds gliding in our eyes
We know peace when they are restless
Mists sailing on staff, allegro
Playing the song of tristesse deathless

Tangent to my deeds, the conduct; my actions,
refulgent with viscosity
Swallowing into themselves,
pinioned motions continually enmeshed 

To nullify the shrieking nothingness,
the successional blustering intervals
I drag weights of bedrocks with me
I bring together impossible walls 

A suspended line, a tense fiber
Cutting through ether unbent
The ray of my soul, impartible
Accompanying one's deafening tranquil

Fuck you motherfucker and 
let me perform a song of
mourning for you right now

The howling clouds gliding in our eyes
We know peace when they are restless
Mists sailing on staff, allegro`,
    "The Paramount Tenor": `It will not enter their minds:
Death-life nourishment the paramount tenor
Treads on essence-suns alive
Windings so terrifying, of our splendor

Depth charges from the lost ones transmuting
an obtuse, solipsistic radar did not miss
In your face explodes compounded tramples

Hasn't he lost his voice already
Hasn't she masticated your decay
Isn't it us the bedrock’s pitying
Doesn’t for me total death blaze

Me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me!`,
    Avalanche: `Ah, you see from below
You have welcomed yourself
Confluence only an animate fist knows
Misadventure that Shackleton envies

Inkling in advance of all
Have you ever seen the orchestra
Playing not on the mezzanine
But on the highest balcony

What privilege to have been succumbed
To a crescendo
Slabs of not turpitude
A stauchwall not of senseless wrath

Participation you will not abhor
Your haughty strides we ask to halt
You must observe well-deserved resplendence

I give credit where credit is due
You created fantastic incomprehensiveness
Here is a signature of Debasement
So your royalties will be paid in full

Amusing, rash crown fracture lines
Rushing to hasten an onslaught to ravage
No more evident can cause and effect be
In an inverted quietus space

I see from above
I have redeemed myself
Gremlins introduced to the outcrop
Imps subdued and squelched

The transient knows of substance
Halt and feel no more
Contemptuous impulse-latensification
Perfunctory smile of a static eum-yang `,
    Supermirage: `My ears not free from green surf's roar  
Innocent cascades of marred waves
Each iteration of me wandering here  
The liminal walls brood just the same

Persistence of impressionist fair weather
Speaks to me of incandescent gloom
Quests with no purpose stringed together
Tied around a neck of arcanum

I am awake in the same place
Eyes peeled for dissatisfaction
Evoked nothing the vignette of a dream 
This is content — in it motions my chords

Mute visage of this coniferous hill
As if waiting for me to unearth verity
Beckons me to stand in my ashen feel
Moribund ether an atmosphere of peat

Hypnagogia a refraction boundary
No state the image doesn't live in
Tarnished by mystery in gradient
Is my own elysian reverie reflected back to me`,
    "Triangular Hour": `Me god
Oh you know me
Where'd you come from

Me god
Oh you know me
Where'd you come from

Me god
Oh you know me
Where'd you come from

Me god
Oh you know me
Where'd you come from`,

  "Thousand Mile Stare": {
    "Congested Tortuosa": `Dissociated, unattached scanning -
A shocked, static object detection
My obliterated gaze point,
an unfocusing transparent biconvex

Ripples of thoughts trickle down inside
my Fagus sylvatica, barely detected
Unrelenting numbness,
behind which lies a Tortuosa`,
    Macrocosm: `I exhibit non-exhibition -
I'm aligned with non-alignment
Devoid switchbacks, neural zigzags
prohibit my advertence

Bleaching bleakness
Plutonian, morose seashores
Godforsaken macrocosm radared`,
    Moribundity: `Complete stasis of my mind
burns through itself, chews its way out
Level zero contemplation prevails
A hollow mind-shape withers

They keep popping into existence
Specks of light, particles of gleam
To be canceled as soon as they come
To instantly kill themselves off

Moribundity of my system
Inexhaustibly maintained
Anvils colliding with hemispheres
Insure the induration`,
    "Coil To Strike": `Disenthralling, disengagement
Latensified blueprints illuminated
My extreme proposition for myself
My eternal intrepidity
Brazen, activated
Magnetization

I am actuated
Cranked up, set off, convalescent
Ebullient, exuberant, riotous, excessive
I'm shaped into myself
I steamroll the blades of quiescence
Solvent for my moratorium

Mendacity dissolved
Inverted on themselves doldrums within me
My suspension, the blistering abeyance
atomized by detonative designs

Anti-prostation
coiling to strike
Potent springs of omnipotence
explode to displace defeats

In mid-air interpolate,
intercalate into fibers of self!`,
  },
  Stochasticity: {
    Stochasticity: `Incoherent thought-vomits
Droplets of acid ail
An ill and endless stream
Of odd harmonics

Was lifted up and beyond
To meet the exosphere
Dissolved by ants
Destroyed by battering crests

Generations of noise
Oceans of stochasticity
Confide in me:
Drummed to bits, these all will be; sojourn

And illuminating
With flashes of void
Fluid serialized

Feral actions determined
Fanatic cruelties for
Ourselves enclosing on
Ritualistic deconstruction

Decadence remorseless
Filling the atmosphere
Ruinous conflagration
Ending cycles of hubris

Bedrock sleeps stoic
Visions speak of ailing ground
Twisting through me
Mind's-eye sees true

Soaring in waves
Owned by the tides
Waters undeprived `,
    "Triangular Mutineers": `Imposing walls are amassing here
A plethora of stinging obelisks
Clear eye shows mere triangular mutineers
A simple synarchy of mere diminished vectors

Forms and shapes instantly reduced
Navigating contours asphyxiated
I hear unfocused arrows swimming in aether
Revealing hopeless zero-dimensional globes`,
    Blackened: `Wretched tides of exhaustion cry
Exhaling winds breaking silence
Violently wrenching, breaking, cracking
Balance shifting into nothing

Anguished now bereft of voice
Bespeckled in agonizing splinters
Hatred gnawing, clawing, scraping
Perpetuating this looming murk

Stifling the shine, always 'mine, mine, mine'
Viewpoint internal feed gluttonous discourse
Grotesquely fattened, corpulent and bloated
Seething with desperation

Growing mighty, swollen, bloated
Depraved and blackened `,
    "Stygian Corner": `Gilded web of our designs
Incessant fallacious paradigms
Long exposed by emptied cries
Inevitably, the opposition dies

Backed into a stygian corner
Impregnates minds with horror
Hawk's sight surveys tomorrow
We live on borrowed time

Woe be to the cerebral
Calculated our descent
Our demise will be identical
Your's and the miscreant's

Struggling against oppressive tides
Creates a world
A world of fatalistic suicide `,
    "Dishonest Shapes": `Piercing cries unobservable
A cornucopia of emptied shouts
Utterings unspeakable in the fabric
A profusion of suspended nulls

Shells of collapsing dishonest shapes
Frames disjointed, fractalizing
Shifting particulate matter dissipates
Illusions deconstructed in a blink of the eye

The mesh of infinitesimal guillotines
Sever sharp angled limbs, minimalizing
Oversaturation of fallaciousness
This plexus decongested gains air to breathe `,
