          Founded by Patrick Park in 2009 having already had produced other styles
          of music for seven years, <i>Tegara</i> is an experimental death metal
          project that's in the past gone with various other names such as Vres.

          Stylistically, groove metal and maybe even deathcorish influences can be
          heard on the older records, while gradually fading away with each new
          record towards a more avant-garde/death metal oriented sound.
          Influences range from soundtracks and contemporary classical music to
          death metal, black metal and experimental music.
