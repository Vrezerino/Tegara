            I used to wonder how does it manifest in practice, the notion that
            humans "weren't meant" to handle such vast social networks on social
            media. After all, I thought people have good internal filters, good
            judgment and they know to block content that could potentially mess
            with their thinking. Around the turn of the millennium we also heard
            "don't believe everything you read on the internet and be safe in
            it".

            One of the stupidest things I've seen lately is contrarian arguments{' '}
            <i>for</i> the usage of AI, not <i>against</i> it. It's this
            reaction against a perceived herd that supposedly doesn't think and
            just repeats what most everyone says, and for these contrarians it
            doesn't matter whether it's the truth or not. Corporations now live
            in the AI bubble and attempt to push it everywhere or lie about
            layoffs using AI as an excuse. I <i>am</i> for the usage of AI in
            health tech (insofar as helping with diagnosis and medicine
            development) and to limited extent software development, but not
            outside of those.

            These contrarians don't think past the initial irritation: how is
            meaningful original content going to survive if we submit to
            artificial "intelligence" and slop content? How can anything be
            trusted any longer?

            You can't handle the internet and your head is too soft for it if
            its phenomena modifies your thinking this much. You didn't heed your
            own advice. Maybe you just have a double-digit IQ.
