# Tegara

Praised for its massive and aggressive production, complex riffs, heart-wrenching melodies and its esoteric, surreal lyrics, Tegara is a one-man music project that's probably best described as a mix of avant-garde metal, experimental metal, progressive metal, death metal and groove metal, with some influences from contemporary classical/soundtrack music and ambient music. It was founded in 2009 and went through a couple name changes before settling on the current one.

I compose and record everything; vocals, electric guitar (Strandberg Boden 8 Classic White), bass guitar (Sojing hollowbody bass). The drums are programmed, and have usually been Superior Drummer 2 and 3. Sometimes I replace the shells (toms, snare, kick) with my own programmed kit that I constructed on Kontakt. I also mix and master everything myself, and have written all the lyrics except on one release where I wrote together with Forest "Tephomab" Raible.
